Admin Dashboard assignment for The Odin Project

This project really opened up the abilities of using a grid to organize and style a website.

This was actually a very special one to me, as Layla is my dog and I actually created all of the icon art by hand on my iPad. I really enjoyed this project, and spent a bit more time than I should have, but I learned a lot.
